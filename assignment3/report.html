        Explanation: Coupling and Cohesion
    </h2>
    <div class="divText">
	<p>
		The design for our software has high cohesion in a few ways. Each class is made to handle one distinct function and mostly operates on its own data. And then we used generalization with inheritance to separate these specific classes by each user that would be affected by that class's actions. The inherited classes would work together to perform their separate functions for their user. Our design has little coupling in the classes. With each class made for one function, each class needs only a limited amount of interaction with other classes. The classes will use each other for one specific purpose and then move on, not using the other functions or methods in the class until they are called to perform their purpose. This makes for a "good" design since each class could be easily altered with the addition of another inheritance class to work for a new programming assignment.
